# React Developer Roadmap: From Fundamentals to Advanced

This roadmap is designed to take you from the fundamentals to advanced, real-world concepts. Each module introduces new topics, builds upon the last, and includes relevant interview questions to solidify your knowledge. We'll use modern tools like Vite for our development environment and TypeScript in the later stages.

## 5-Project Learning Plan

### **Module 1: The Foundations ‚Äì Dynamic To-Do List üìù**

**Project:**  
A clean, functional To-Do List application where you can add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them.

**Core Concepts:**
- Project Setup: Using Vite (`npm create vite@latest`)
- JSX: Writing HTML-like syntax in JavaScript
- Functional Components: The building blocks of your UI
- Props: Passing data from parent to child components
- State: Managing component-level data with the `useState` hook
- Events: Handling user interactions like clicks and form submissions
- Conditional Rendering: Displaying UI elements based on state (e.g., a "completed" style)
- Lists and Keys: Rendering dynamic lists of items correctly

**Interview Questions:**
- What is JSX and how is it different from HTML?
- Explain the difference between State and Props.
- Why are keys important when rendering a list of elements in React?
- What is a React Hook? Can you name two and explain what they do?
- How do you update the state of a component?

### **Module 2: Side Effects & Data Fetching ‚Äì Weather App üå¶Ô∏è**

**Project:**  
A simple weather application where a user can enter a city name and see the current weather conditions fetched from a free weather API (like OpenWeatherMap).

**Core Concepts:**
- The `useEffect` Hook: Performing side effects, such as fetching data after a component renders
- Asynchronous JavaScript: Using `async/await` with the fetch API
- API Interaction: Making GET requests to a REST API
- State Management for API Data: Handling loading, error, and success states
- Controlled Components: Managing form inputs using state

**Interview Questions:**
- What is a "side effect" in React?
- Explain the useEffect dependency array. What happens if it's empty? What if it's omitted?
- How would you handle errors when fetching data from an API?
- What is the difference between a controlled and an uncontrolled component?
- Describe the component lifecycle in a modern functional React component.

### **Module 3: App Architecture & Routing ‚Äì Mini Blog üì∞**

**Project:**  
A mini blog with a home page (listing all posts), a single post page (showing the full content), and an "About" page.

**Core Concepts:**
- Client-Side Routing: Understanding how SPAs work
- React Router: The de-facto standard library for routing in React
- Router Setup: Using `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, and `Route`
- Navigation: Creating links with the `Link` component
- Dynamic Routes: Creating routes based on parameters (e.g., `/posts/:postId`)
- URL Parameters: Using the `useParams` hook
- Layout Components: Creating shared UI elements like a Navbar and Footer
- Styling: Introducing a modern styling solution like Tailwind CSS

**Interview Questions:**
- What is the main difference between a traditional multi-page application and a single-page application (SPA)?
- How does React Router work under the hood?
- What is the difference between using a `<Link>` component and a regular `<a>` tag?
- How can you programmatically navigate a user to another page? (Hint: `useNavigate` hook)
- Explain the concept of "Nested Routes".

### **Module 4: Global State Management ‚Äì E-commerce Shopping Cart üõí**

**Project:**  
A product listing page where users can add items to a global shopping cart. The cart's state (items and total count) will be accessible from any component, like the main navigation bar.

**Core Concepts:**
- Prop Drilling: Understanding the problem we're trying to solve
- The Context API: React's built-in way to share state without prop drilling
- The `useContext` Hook: Consuming data from a Context Provider
- The `useReducer` Hook: Managing more complex state logic, often paired with Context
- Global State: Creating a "shopping cart" state that is available throughout the entire app

**Interview Questions:**
- What is prop drilling and why is it considered a problem?
- Explain what the React Context API is used for.
- When would you choose to use `useReducer` over `useState`?
- Can you explain the "Provider" and "Consumer" model in React Context?
- What are the potential performance downsides of using Context, and how can they be mitigated?

### **Module 5: Modern React & Performance ‚Äì Kanban Board üöÄ**

**Project:**  
A Trello-like Kanban board where you can drag and drop tasks between columns ("To Do," "In Progress," "Done"). We'll build this entire project using TypeScript.

**Core Concepts:**
- TypeScript: Adding static types to your React application for better maintainability and error checking
- Modern Data Fetching: Using a library like TanStack Query (React Query) to manage server state, caching, and re-fetching
- Performance Optimization:
  - `React.memo`: Preventing unnecessary re-renders of components
  - `useCallback`: Memoizing functions
  - `useMemo`: Memoizing computed values
- Advanced State: Handling more complex state logic like drag-and-drop interactions

**Interview Questions:**
- Why would you use TypeScript in a React project? What are the main benefits?
- What problems do libraries like TanStack Query (React Query) solve compared to just using `useEffect` and `fetch`?
- Explain the difference between `React.memo`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo`. When would you use each?
- What is "server state" versus "client state"?
- How would you debug a React component that is re-rendering too often?
